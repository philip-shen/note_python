QtScrcpy connects to Android devices via USB (or via TCP/IP) for display and control. It does NOT require the root privileges.

It supports three major platforms: GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS.

It focuses on:

    lightness (native, displays only the device screen)
    performance (30~60fps)
    quality (1920Ã—1080 or above)
    low latency (35~70ms)
    low startup time (~1 second to display the first image)
    non-intrusiveness (nothing is left installed on the device)
```

```
A naive client of Scrcpy in Python. Currently it can only decode video stream from the server.

This client was inspired by py-scrcpy.
```
## 1. Install OpenCV for Python. Naive Scrcpy Client use OpenCV for GUI. You can replace it with PIL or anything else easily.
```
pip install opencv-python
```

## 2. Copy/link recent ffmpeg shared libraries to ./lib, the required files were listed below. Make sure the version of libs matches to the architecture of your Python (e.g. x86->32bit).
```
    Windows:

avcodec-58.dll
avformat-58.dll
avutil-56.dll
swresample-3.dll

    Linux:

libavcodec.so
libavformat.so
libavutil.so
